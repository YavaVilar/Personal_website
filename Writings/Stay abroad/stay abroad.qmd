When I decided to study abroad, I packed my suitcases with great enthusiasm, happy to be able to complete a journey that I had long awaited. 

I calculated what I would need, I packed clothes, blankets, personal belongings, books. Knowing what to leave and what to pack was almost an art: I should not overpack, but nothing could be missing either. 

What I didn't know was everything that would come with me without being packed. Everything that cannot be measured or weighed.

It is the feelings, the moments, the people.

The illusion and curiosity was what most characterized my beginning, before the first flight. I was nervous, intrigued by the new, I felt strong, capable, and with a lot of determination. 

Then came the first flight. I had the privilege of being accompanied by my parents, until they left. The moment when the first cry came. I was alone in front of the new, a new country. No more living under their shelter and protection. Maybe it was the pain of love, union and separation at the same time.

Soon I overcame that first break with the familiar, although new forms of farewell awaited me later. 

New challenges. Studies, it was difficult, I was perfectionist. Friendships, there were many from my culture, I got along with others. The rain, I liked the sun. 

I can't fit in my suitcase the times I felt strong for solving something, alone. For creating a friendship. For passing an exam. For knowing how to ask questions. 

There is no room for the moments of doubt, of emptiness. Nor the moments of clarity and purpose. I had many clear things, that stopped making sense, until they gained strength again.

One year passed, and another one came. Another one in which I would never fit in my suitcase the great number of people I met, who touched my soul. Those who let themselves be known, and who helped me let myself be known.

The suitcase is too small for the immensity that they brought me. The parties, the dances, the hugs, the love. 

My thoughts in double language do not enter, nor the links I created with my faculty, nor the days of companionship classes. With them, with people of the country. Nor the endless projects that, as well as restlessness, brought me a lot of learning.

The last year has arrived. And I'm still here, with no room for each additional day, full of a new adventure, a new discovery, a new emotion. 

Anxiety, nostalgia, uncertainty, fear and illusion. These are feelings that could not enter, that first day, and that will not be able to enter either, in the return. But they are always present. 

The people, the experiences, the bumps, the mistakes, the learning, the progress. All this characterizes my stay abroad, and will always come with me, even if they don't check it at the airport, even if they don't understand it when I return, even if sometimes I don't even know how to explain it. 

My suitcase will come back lighter, but not me.
