In many practical scenarios, managing large datasets becomes essential. To effectively handle these, advanced techniques beyond traditional econometric methods are required. Dimension reduction approaches and penalized regressions, aimed at conducting variable selection, are able to address this issue and provide confident and interpretable results. This study explores all these methods using a high-dimensional database containing economic indicators for Canada. The outcome of interest is the employment rate, with more than 200 variables representing its potential determinants. Results have shown similar predictors deemed relevant across penalized regressions, with unemployment rate values and lagged employment levels as the primary determinants.
