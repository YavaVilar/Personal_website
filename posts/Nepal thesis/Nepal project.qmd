Earthquakes are natural phenomena beyond human control, capable of causing significant damage and human suffering. Some countries are geographically prone to earthquakes, and the resulting impacts can affect many aspects of society. For the dissertation of my first year in the Master's program, I studied the consequences that the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal had on children's health, specifically focusing on cough prevalence. Nepal is an underdeveloped country where many children still do not have access to decent and dignified living conditions. I was highly motivated to investigate this topic and to apply the econometric tools I had recently acquired in the Master's program.

Data cleaning, management, and analysis were major parts of the project. I worked with DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys) data files, using R and Stata as the main statistical software. The literature review and writing of the paper completed the task. Below you can find a summary of the research question, the methodology employed, and the main findings of the study, which have been summarized from the sixty pages I originally wrote. Additionally, you can find a pdf-version of my oral presentation support (that I presented interactively with R-Shiny, not with the pdf).
