This study examines the empirical validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve for Latin America and the Caribbean over the period 2002â€“2020. The curve explores the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation, suggesting that in the early stages of economic development, environmental pollution tends to increase. However, once a given region reaches a certain level of economic wealth, environmental quality begins to improve.

By comparing different panel models, our final fixed-effects model (accounting for both country and year) confirms the Kuznets hypothesis in our study context.
