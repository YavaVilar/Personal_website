This work analyzes the empirical validity of the Kuznets environmental curve for the Latin American continent throughout the 2002â€“2020 period. The curve analyzes the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation, stipulating that in the first stages of economic development, environmental pollution tends to increase, whereas once a particular territory reaches a turning point of economic wealth, the quality of the environment will improve. Comparing different panel models, a final country and year fixed effects model confirms the Kuznets theory in our study context
