In my second year of studying Economics, I wrote a short essay for the Economic History course on a topic that seemed particularly interesting to me: how Spain industrialized unevenly in the nineteenth century and how this led to increased regional economic inequality. Industrialization was a significant process in history that brought about many important changes in societies, such as the introduction of machinery and advanced technologies, urbanization, capitalism and economic growth, and shifts in mentality and political ideas. However, inequalities became a major issue, as the gap between the rich and the poor widened. This could occur on an individual level due to disparities in income between owners and workers, but it could also be pronounced at a regional level, where industrialization affected some regions first while others remained stagnant. My essay focused on this latter case.
