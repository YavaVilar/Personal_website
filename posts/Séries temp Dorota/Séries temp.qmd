Mortality rate reflects the number of children who die before reaching the age of five per 1,000 live births. In Nepal, this rate has historically been high due to factors such as poverty, limited access to healthcare, and undernutrition, though it has shown significant improvement over recent decades.

Using World Bank annual data from 1960 onwards, I applied the Box-Jenkins methodology to analyze the time series of under-five mortality in Nepal. The objective was to identify the most appropriate ARIMA model to capture the underlying trends and generate reliable forecasts. Additionally, I examined the relationship between under-five mortality and two key socio-economic variables: the fertility rate and GDP per capita.
