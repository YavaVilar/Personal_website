In the first year of my Master's in Econometrics, I took a course on time series, specifically revolving about ARIMA models, which are used to analyze data over time and forecast values based on past information. The evolution of under-five mortality in Nepal caught my attention. I downloaded data from the World Bank, where I found the mortality rate from 1960 onwards. In my work, I explained the foundations of the methodology employed, the Box-Jenkins technique, as well as the theory behind ARIMA models, to identify a model that fits the data and provides the best possible forecasts. Likewise, I studied the relationship between the under-five mortality rate and two of its potential determinants: the fertility rate and the GDP per capita level. You can find the project below.
