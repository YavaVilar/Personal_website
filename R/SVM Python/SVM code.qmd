An SVM (Support Vector Machine) model is a supervised machine learning algorithm used primarily for classification tasks. It works by finding a hyperplane that best separates data into distinct classes. SVMs aim to maximize the margin between the closest points of the different classes, called support vectors. The algorithm is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is particularly useful for tasks where data is not linearly separable.

The notebook that you will find below focuses on the explainability of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) through practical exercises. It discusses methods for interpreting SVM models, including techniques to visualize decision boundaries, assess feature importance, and understand how input features influence predictions.
