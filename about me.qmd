Hi! I am an MSc graduate in Econometrics from the [University of Nantes](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/), with a BSc in Economics from both the [University of Nantes](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/) and the [Universitat de Val√®ncia](https://www.uv.es/). 

I am passionate about exploring how economics and data can help us understand society and tackle today's pressing issues. I enjoy not only addressing questions of social and economic nature, but also writing and engaging in thorough and creative work. My academic and international experiences have shaped my global perspective and sparked a deep curiosity about the world. Throughout my studies, I developed skills in econometric modeling and data analysis, and I am particularly interested in applying them to challenges such as poverty and inequality.

Outside of academia, I like dancing (bachata and salsa), nature-related activities (mountains, beach), and reading books (philosophy, psychology). 

Feel free to reach me out at [vilarvaleray@gmail.com](mailto:vilarvaleray+site@gmail.com) would you like to connect.
