## About me

Born in Valencia, I grew up in Navaluenga, a small village in the province of Ávila, Spain. I later moved to Belgium where I lived for three years and learnt French. Then, I returned to Valencia, where, in 2020, I began my degree in Economics at the [Universitat de València](https://www.uv.es/). Two years later I enrolled in an International Double Degree program with [Nantes Université](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/), which allowed me to obtain my Bachelor in Economics from both universities in 2024.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's program in [Econometrics and Statistics](https://sites.google.com/view/master-ecap/accueil) at Nantes University, where I have acquired extensive skills in software and data management, in addition to enhancing my statistical abilities to analyze economic issues.

I define myself as a very passionate and motivated student, with a strong willingness to learn and achieve new goals. Not only do I like addressing questions of social and economic nature, but also writing and engaging in thorough and creative work. My academic and international experiences have shaped my global perspective and sparked a deep curiosity about the world. This drives my interest in working on global challenges.
