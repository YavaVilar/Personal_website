## About me

My name is Yava Vilar Valera.

I was born in Valencia, Spain. I grew up in Navaluenga, a small village in the province of Avila, Spain. I later moved to Belgium where I lived for three years and where I learnt french. Then, I returned to Valencia, where, in 2020, I began my Degree in Economics at the [Universitat de València](https://www.uv.es/). Two years later I enrolled in an International Double Degree program with [Nantes Université](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/), through which I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economics from both universities in 2024.

Currently I am pursuing a Master's degree in [Econometrics and Statistics](https://sites.google.com/view/master-ecap/accueil) at Nantes University, focusing on applied econometrics and data science.

I define myself as a very passionate and motivated student, with a strong willingness to learn and achieve my goals. Not only do I enjoy answering questions of social and economic nature, but also writing, languages, and engaging in thorough and creative work.
