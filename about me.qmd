## About me - bio & interests 

Born in Valencia, Spain, I grew up in Navaluenga, a small village in the province of Ávila, Spain. I later moved to Belgium where I lived for three years and learned French. Then, I returned to Valencia, where, in 2020, I began my Degree in Economics at the [Universitat de València](https://www.uv.es/). Two years later I enrolled in an International Double Degree program with [Nantes Université](https://www.univ-nantes.fr/). This unique opportunity allowed me to obtain my Bachelor in Economics from both universities in 2024.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's program in [Econometrics and Statistics](https://sites.google.com/view/master-ecap/accueil) at Nantes University, where I have acquired extensive skills in software and data management, in addition to enhancing my statistical abilities to analyze economic issues.

I define myself as a very passionate and motivated student, with a strong willingness to learn and achieve new goals. Not only do I like addressing questions of social and economic nature, but also writing and engaging in thorough and creative work. My academic background and experiences living in different countries have shaped my global perspective and sparked a deep curiosity about the world. This drives my interest in working on global challenges.
