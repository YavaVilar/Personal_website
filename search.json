    "section": "",
    "text": "In my second year of studying Economics, I wrote a short essay for the Economic History course on a topic that seemed particularly interesting to me: how Spain industrialized unevenly in the nineteenth century and how this led to increased regional economic inequality. Industrialization was a significant process in history that brought about many important changes in societies, such as the introduction of machinery and advanced technologies, urbanization, capitalism and economic growth, and shifts in mentality and political ideas. However, inequalities became a major issue, as the gap between the rich and the poor widened. This could occur on an individual level due to disparities in income between owners and workers, but it could also be pronounced at a regional level, where industrialization affected some regions first while others remained stagnant. My essay focused on this latter case."

    "title": "M1 Dissertation: Assessing the Impact of the Nepal 2015 Gorkha Earthquake on Children Health",
    "section": "",
    "text": "About the project\nFor the dissertation of my first year in the Master’s program, I inquired about the consequences that the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal had on children’s health, and more specifically, on cough prevalence. Nepal is an underdeveloped country where many children still do not have access to decent and dignified living conditions, while earthquakes can aggravate these issues. I was highly motivated to conduct research on this topic and to apply the econometric tools I had recently acquired in the Master.\nData cleaning, management, and analysis were major parts of the project. I worked with DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys) data files, using RStudio and Stata as the main statistical software. The literature review and writing of the paper completed the task. Below you can find a summary of the study framework, the data and methodology employed, and the main findings of the study, which have been summarized from the sixty pages I originally wrote.\n\n\n1. Research Statement and Study Framework\nEarthquakes, being one of the most devastating natural phenomena on Earth, can cause great damage to human health, fostering, in addition to numerous emotional damages, the emergence of diseases. Among them, cough can reduce the quality of life of those who suffer from it, and its frequency in the population may increase after an earthquake, given the resulting dust and pollution, the loss of economic means and the worsening of the quality and quantity of clinical services available, among others. Children under five represent a group of individuals in society who are particularly susceptible to diseases, while their physical and emotional well-being is essential for their development as individuals. The analysis seeks to identify the extent of damage caused, in terms of prevalence of childhood coughing, by the 2015 Nepal Gorkha earthquake.\n\n\n2. Data\nIn the study, Demographic and Health Surveys datasets are utilized, a set of nationally representative surveys that collect information on health and demographics in developing countries. Conducted by ICF International and funded primarily by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), these surveys address topics such as infant mortality, nutrition, reproductive health, and family planning, providing detailed and internationally comparable information. DHS contain several data files for different family members, such as woman, man, children, and households. In the analysis, children and households’ files regarding the country of Nepal for the years 2011 (5,038 observations) and 2016 (5,306 observations) are managed. Additionally, geographic coordinates of each surveyed household were required to compute distances to the earthquake’s epicentres, a key aspect of the research. Geospatial data have also been included to specify control variables in the model.\n\n\n3. Econometric methodology\nThe Difference-in-Differences is employed as empirical strategy, an econometric technique used to estimate the causal effect of an intervention or policy by comparing changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group, made up of units who receive the intervention, and a control group that serves as counterfactual for treated individuals (i.e. what would have happened to the treatment group in the absence of the intervention). In this case, the earthquake is interpreted as the intervention. Therefore, we consider that individuals under the treatment are children living in areas close to epicentres, whereas the control set is composed of children who live in remote areas. I have measured the impact on cough prevalence considering as treated the children living within a wide range of kilometres of either of the two epicentres (Gorkha district on 15 April, 7,8 magnitude; and Dolakha district, on 12 may, 7,3 magnitude), with the remaining area of the country as control units, the main results of which will be shown below. The mathematical equation is presented next:\nYit = α + d = α + β1𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 + β2𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 + β3 (Treatment ∗ Post) 𝑖𝑡 + β4X𝑖𝑡 + β5D𝑖𝑡\nWhere 𝑌 reflects the outcome of interest (cough prevalence) for individual 𝑖 at time 𝑡; α is a constant; β the coeƯicient of each correspondent variable; 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 indicates whether the child belongs to the treatment area (1 if that is the case, 0 otherwise); and 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 takes the value 1 if individuals belong to the post-earthquake group, 0 if not. X corresponds to a set of control variables and D represents region fixed effects. Finally, ϵ is the error term.\n\n\n4. Results\nFindings have demonstrated a significant impact up to a distance of 80 kilometers. Table 1 presents the estimates obtained from the above equation considering this distance range. β3 , the coefficient corresponding to the variable Treatment*After, is the DiD estimator which measures the causal effect of the treatment. Its significance at the 10% threshold indicates a significant difference, over the two periods analysed, in the cough rate in the areas affected by the earthquake relative to non-affected regions. The positiveness of the sign indicates that being within 80 kilometers of in the post-treatment group increases the likelihood of coughing compared to the remaining areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of cough prevalence in both treatment and control groups from the year 2001. We can observe how the cough incidence index, measured from 0 to 1 as a proportion of the sample analysed, has decreased for both groups in the ten years prior to the earthquake, although it increased slowly in 2011 relative to 2006. After the shock in 2015, the proportion of children suffering from the disease goes up, even if not in a very pronounced way, for treated children. The control region, on the contrary, slightly lowers its cough incidence. The groups compared do not perfectly exhibit parallel trends during the pre-earthquake period, although they are high similar. Even though covariates have been included in the model, possibly they would not have followed an exactly parallel evolution in the absence of treatment, and this could represent some source of little bias in the results. Figure 2 exhibits a map of Nepal showing the two major epicenters as well as the households surveyed who have been found to be injured by the earthquake.\n\n\n\n5. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the study has analysed the impact that the 2015 Gorkha earthquake of Nepal had on the prevalence of cough in children under five. For that, groups close to epicenters have been compared to the remaining regions of the country over time. Results have revealed an increase in the rate of the disease in areas within a circle of up to 80 kilometers of any of the two major epicenters. Given the frequency of earthquakes in Nepal and its low buildings construction quality, it is recommended to invest in resistant material to these hazards. Likewise, the importance of counting with health services and qualified professionals after such an event is highlighted. Children are the future of society, and their care is crucial for their development and happiness."

    "text": "Irse a vivir, trabajar o estudiar fuera suele ser una experiencia que llama mucho la atención. Unos lo temen y prefieren evitarlo, otros lo idealizan y esperan aprender de ella un sinfín de cosas. Una de las maneras más comunes y fáciles hoy en día, si eres estudiante, de conseguir pasar un tiempo en el extranjero es a través de las becas Erasmus.\nEn mi caso, como estudiante de Economía en la Universidad de Valencia, quise participar en un programa de Doble Titulación Internacional con la Universidad de Nantes. Es decir, fue un intercambio de dos años en los que culminé mi carrera con los títulos de graduada de estas dos universidades. En mi universidad de destino me trataron como una estudiante propia de la universidad y seguí todas las clases e hice todos los exámenes con una promoción común, al igual que ocurrió durante mis dos primeros años en Valencia.\nEl programa que decidí escoger me intereso desde un principio ya que buscaba vivir fuera durante un tiempo prolongado. El francés es un idioma que ya conocía con anterioridad, lo cual facilito que me aceptaran en el programa, y siendo una persona a la que le gusta estudiar, quise añadir ese plus a mi carrera universitaria.\nestudios\nA las pocas semanas de llegar, me di cuenta de que cursar una Doble Titulación no solo requiere esfuerzo académico, sino también un gran compromiso personal. Es mucho más que estudiar en una nueva universidad: implica gestionar tu vida de forma independiente, desde las amistades que construyes hasta las decisiones y responsabilidades que asumes en lo cotidiano. Todo esto, en un entorno donde las costumbres, horarios y formas de comportarse son diferentes a lo que conocía.\nEn cuanto a la adaptación al país, esta fue relativamente sencilla para mí, ya que tenía conocimientos previos de francés y había vivido experiencias similares al mudarme anteriormente tanto dentro como fuera de mi país. Sin embargo, lo que realmente supuso un reto durante los primeros meses fue la exigencia académica. Ahí fue donde me di cuenta de la responsabilidad y el coraje necesarios para alcanzar altos objetivos mientras estudiaba en el extranjero. A medida que el tiempo pasaba y me adaptaba al nuevo sistema de aprendizaje, al ritmo de clases y examenes, se fue volviendo mas llevadero. No porque realmente el nivel de exigencia hubiera bajado, sino porque ya lo habia integrado en mi vida.\nvida social"

    "text": "Mi experiencia\nA continuación dividiré mi experiencia en algunas categorías : la ciudad, vida social, estudios, y consejos que le daría a cualquier persona que quiera estudiar en el extranjero.\n\nLa ciudad\nNantes es una ciudad situada en el noroeste de Francia, capital de la región Loire-Atlantique. Cuenta con mas de 300 000 habitantes y una gran vida universitaria. Para los españoles, Nantes podría ser considerada la Salamanca de Francia. Es una ciudad de tamaño medio, ni pequeña ni grande, aunque con mucho ocio, no necesitaras trasladarte a otras grandes ciudades para encontrar los servicios más comunes. A tres horas y media en coche de Burdeos y de Paris, se queda algo alejada de otras grandes ciudades del país, aunque hay bonitas ciudades más pequeñas que visitar a los alrededores como Rennes, La Rochelle, Angers, y pueblos con encanto y playa como Pornic. El clima deja algo que desear, ya que suele llover con frecuencia y estar nublado. Aun así, que no se exagere demasiado: también hay días de sol, y momentos de calor he pasado. Sin embargo, no suele ser suficiente. Un paraguas y vitamina D en pastillas sería una recomendación para vivir en esta ciudad. El transporte más común entre las personas jóvenes es el tranvía. Pasa con bastante frecuencia y está bien conectado, e incluso por las noches los fines de semana (viernes y sábados) hay servicio hasta las 2:30 de la madrugada y vuelve a funcionar desde las 4:30, lo cual es una ventaja si te gusta la vida nocturna. También hay autobuses y bicicletas que puedes alquilar. Durante los dos anos de mi estancia, estuve alojada en una habitación estudiantil en una residencia que la universidad reserva para los estudiantes internacionales. Se trata de una residencia publica gestionada por el CROUS, cuyo precio es asequible en comparación con el ámbito privado. Mi habitación tenía 9 metros cuadrados, un baño individual, una nevera y congelador, con cocina compartida. Aunque no era muy grande, conté con el espacio necesario para dormir, estudiar, moverme, e incluso en una ocasión dos amigas de España vinieron a visitarme y pudimos dormir tres personas en esos pocos metros cuadrados! En cuanto a deportes, Nantes hay muchas instalaciones deportivas cercanas a los campus universitarios y muchas opciones baratas para estudiantes. Un abono de 50 euros anuales permite a un estudiante practicar hasta tres deportes diferentes a la semana, dentro de una gran variedad de deportes que elegir. En mi caso, el primer año me inscribí a esta opción, hice escalada, bádminton y probe el gimnasio. El segundo ano opté por ir de vez en cuando a nadar de forma libre a una piscina para tal efecto cerca de mi facultad y residencia. Finalmente, los precios de Nantes son algo mas caros que en España, sobre todo a nivel de precio de alojamiento, comida, transporte y ocio, pero a nivel de servicios para estudiantes, suele ser mas asequible. Un ejemplo de ello es el deporte mencionado anteriormente. También se puede comer de lunes a viernes en un restaurante CROUS por 3,30 el menú. Además, hay mas ayudas publicas y las becas son mas generosas.\n\n\nVida social\nMi vida social en Nantes ha sido bastante favorable ya que soy una persona a la que le gusta salir y hacer planes, y allí he conocido a personas con estos mismos intereses con las que he compartido muchos momentos de diversión y amistad. La gran cantidad de culturas que he conocido hizo mi estancia mucho mas interesante y enriquecedora. Irse a vivir fuera puede unirte mucho a personas de tu mismo pais o de otros paises que esten en la misma situacion que tu, ya que se crea un vinculo de apoyo mutuo en un entorno en el que esto se convierte en algo muy valorado.\nEn mi caso, el primer ano conoci a varias personas procedentes de varias culturas. Por un lado, me hice una amiga española que tenía su habitación a pocas puertas de la mía y que veía a menudo en una de las cocinas de mi residencia, cuya estancia en Nantes fue un ano. Por otro lado, hice buenos amigos de Colombia, que conocí por primera vez a los pocos días de llegar a Nantes en la cocina. Hoy en día sigue siendo mi amigo, aunque la distancia haga que ya no nos veamos físicamente. Cuando él regreso a Colombia, creé amistad con otro colombiano y empezamos a salir de vez en cuando de fiesta con estudiantes internacionales de la misma residencia: uno de Brasil, uno de Alemania, y tres del Líbano. Con ellos me lo pasé realmente bien, fueron las primeras veces que realmente sali con un grupo de chicos con los que me sentía cómoda y feliz. El curso siguiente este grupo se desvaneció ya que todos se fueron de la residencia, algunos regresaron a sus países y otros se mudaron porque la universidad ya no les renovaba una plaza en la residencia. Yo me quedé. Cuando volví en septiembre mi segundo año después de haber pasado el verano en Valencia, y vi que todas estas personas a las que había conocido ya no estaban, me sentí triste y nostálgica, pensando en que no volvería a verlos por los pasillos ni en mi residencia.\nPero la vida sigue adelante, los días fueron pasando, y de nuevo me fui creando nuevas amistades. Entré en un máster que entraba dentro de mi programa de intercambio, y ese ano que me esperaba me trajo muchos momentos increíbles y que disfruté muchísimo. Amigos franceses que a penas hice el primer ano, los hice en el máster, y fueron realmente simpáticas conmigo, me alegraron las clases e hice planes con ellas fuera de la universidad. Además, conocí a mucha gente latina: de México, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Perú… Havana café, en el centro de la ciudad, y el Sao, situado en la isla de Nantes, son los bares que se convirtieron en sitios fijos de ocio. Cada día que salía conocía a alguien nuevo, luego me los volvía a encontrar en el mismo sitio… y con ellos descubrí mi pasión por el baile latino. Bailábamos de manera informal bachata, salsa, merengue, y me encantaba. Luego me apunté a clases de salsa, lo cual me hizo conocer aun a mas gente. Al final, llego un momento en el que salía casi todos los fines de semana, excepto cuando tenia que estudiar mucho, y he tenido experiencias de todo tipo. Algunos momentos menos divertidos ha habido, pero en general, mi vida social en Nantes ha sido muy enriquecedora. Nantes tiene muchas opciones para jóvenes, gente abierta, comunidad latina, franceses a los que le gusta la marcha… ¡Es difícil aburrirse!\n\n\nEstudios\nEn Nantes, como destino erasmus, hay que estudiar. No es extremadamente difícil, pero si hay que esforzarse y dedicarle tiempo a la universidad. Esto en función de los objetivos académicos que tengas, por supuesto. Con revisar la asignatura y conocer lo fundamental de cada curso, no habrá problemas en aprobar. Además, algunos profesores son más generosos con los estudiantes erasmus, hacen exámenes orales individuales y puntúan de manera más flexible. Pero no todos. En mi caso, al estar cursando una doble titulación, me puntuaban como al resto de la clase y hacia siempre los mismos exámenes que ellos. Yo le dedique mucho tiempo al estudio. El primer ano que llegué, me estresé y me sentía insegura frente a la nueva dificultad. Bajé algo mis notas, lo cual me preocupo. Pero seguí esforzándome, porque me importaba. Y así, siguiendo a pesar de las dificultades, uno se adapta y eso que costaba al principio acaba convirtiéndose en algo no tan difícil. El segundo semestre mejoré mis notas, al igual que el segundo ano en el máster. Es importante mencionar que el sistema de notas y aprobados en Francia es diferente al de España. Para empezar, las notas van del 0 a 20, en lugar de 0 a 10. Con un 10 sobre 20, se considera aprobado. Sin embargo, a diferencia de España, las asignaturas se agrupan en bloques de dos o tres asignaturas, y si suspendes una de ellas, puedes compensar con la nota de otra asignatura del mismo bloque. Incluso suspendiendo un bloque entero, puedes compensar con la nota de otro bloque. A fin de cuentas, debes tener una media superior a 10 para pasar de curso sin necesidad de pasar por las recuperaciones. No obstante, a veces hay excepciones de asignaturas o trabajos que hay que aprobar de forma independiente, y que si no lo haces, deberás pasar otro examen, con un máximo de dos oportunidades.  La forma de corregir suele ser mas exigente que en España, y el nivel de dificultad de los exámenes puede variar. En mi caso, he sacado mas 18s/20 en Francia que 9s/10 en España, pero también mas 12s/20 en Francia que 6s/10 en España. En Nantes, he visto notas mas diversas en una misma persona que en Valencia. Digamos que la varianza de las notas en los estudiantes de Nantes es mayor que la de los estudiantes en Valencia, según lo que yo he visto en algunas personas y también en mi propio caso."

    "text": "The link between natural resources and civil wars is a central topic in the study of contemporary conflicts. In many regions, the abundance of resources such as petroleum, minerals, wood, or diamonds has been both a blessing and a curse. While in theory these resources should boost economic development, in practice they have provoked prolonged internal conflicts. Wars tend to intensify around this wealth, as armed groups seek to finance their operations through exploitation of these resources. Similarly, extreme climate events, such as extended droughts, can aggravate tensions by increasing competition for scarce and essential goods like water and arable land.\nI analyzed this relationship in my research document in the third grade of my degree in Economics, written in French. To do this, I based my project on two papers that I synthesized: “Le rôle des ressources naturelles dans les conflits armés africains” by Philippe Hugon (2009) and “Drought and civil war in Sub-Saharan Africa” by Mathieu Couttenier and Raphael Soubeyran (2013)."

In my work, I explained the foundations of the methodology employed, the Box-Jenkins technique, as well as the theory behind ARIMA models, to identify a model that fits the data and provides the best possible forecasts.

These models include Holt-Winters, CES (S)ARIMA and ADAM-ETS models. Population evolution seemed riveting to me and chose Spain as the territory to investigate. I assessed the accuracy of the different models and ultimately used the one that provided the lowest error rate when forecasting.

R was the software I used to manage the data.\n\nIntroduction\nSince the beginning of humanity, world’s population has been continously developing and growing. From a wide range of biological to economic causes that shape it, the population follows a trajectory of great relevance to analyze since this trajectory has numerous implications in the economic and social structure, in addition to other areas as important such as the environment and biodiversity. On the one hand, economic growth has historically driven population growth while a greater number of people stimulates demand for goods and services, employment, and economic activity in general. On the other hand, the limitation of available resources and environmental degradation seems to be greater as the population continues to grow. This work focuses on making prediction tests about the population of Spain based on historical data going from 1277 to 1838, in order find a suitable model that could be used in a real context.\n\n\n1. Data\nData source comes from databases provided by “La Fundación Real del Pino”, a private non-profit organization located in Madrid, Spain. Founded in 2006, its main goal is to promote research in diverse social sciences fields, particularly in economics and economic historical evolution. The series is composed of 561 years, plus 12 years that will be reserved to compare model-predictions with actual values. It is important to note that data before 1750 has been constructed from mathematical equations and models, which may not capture the complexity of the phenomenon they seek to represent. Therefore, careful attention is required when interpreting the results of this analysis.\nAn adjusted series to correct for one Level-Shift (LS) outlier has been constructed. Outliers are atypical, extreme values that can affect the quality of model fit and the reliability of predictions. In this case, the outlier detected in the year 1508 reflects a change of the population’s trajectory from a significant slowdown driven by the expulsion of the Jews from the country to a rapid and natural recovery.\nSimilarly, a differentiation has been applied to the original series in order to meet the stationarity hypotheses (constant mean and variance over time), essential to be able to model the data.\n\n\n2. Linear predictions\n\n2.1. Model’s parameters\nIn order to analyze temporal series and make future predictions, it is essential to previously estimate models that capture the dependence parameters of past values and other predictor variables. The main assumption of linear models is that the relationship between variables is linear. The models’ parameters that have been monopolized are summarized in table 1 and explained next:\n\nTable 1: Model’s parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAR(1)\nARIMA(0,2,2)\nHolt-Winters\nADAM-ETS\nSSARIMA\nCES\n\n\n\n\nAR1\n0.4820\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMA1\n\n-0.5602\n\n\n0.5009\n\n\n\nMA2\n\n-0.4167\n\n\n0.2134\n\n\n\nMA3\n\n\n\n\n0.0755\n\n\n\nAlpha\n\n\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nBeta\n\n\n0.4401\n0.9999\n\n\n\n\nPhi\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nDistribution\nNormal\nNormal\n\nNormal Generalised\nNormal\nPartial\n\n\nAIC\n- 1367.96\n\n-1344.38\n-3395.009\n-1367.81\n-1231.55\n\n\nAICc\n\n\n-1344.33\n-3394.748\n-1367.70\n-1231.50\n\n\n\n\nAR(1): describes how the current value of a variable is influenced by its immediately preceding value and a stochastic error term. The parameter of this model is 0.4820. A value lower than 1 indicates a stationary series that tends to revert its mean, that is, that tends to converge towards a mean value in the long term. The positiveness of the coefficient reveals an increase of each current value as long as time goes up. Indeed, a positive term AR(1) implies that when the value of the time series t-1 is greater than its mean, the value at time t is also greater than its mean, suggesting a pattern of growth over time.\nARIMA: It combines three components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I for Integrated), and moving averages (MA). The AR part of the model uses the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations (previous time points). p is the number of lagged observations included in the model. The I component involves differencing the data to make it stationary. The parameter d indicates the number of times the series is differenciated. The MA part of the model uses the relationship between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. The parameter q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation. Our model is characterised by having two parameters Moving Average processus significant at the 1% level. This shows a dependency relationship between the value at a specific point of time t and error term both at the immediate previous period, t-1, and at the second previous period t-2. Negative coefficients indicates this relationship is negative and the greater coefficient of MA(1) compared to MA(2) suggests that the error term at t-1 has a higher effect on the current value.\nHolt-Winters: Appeared in the 1960s, Holt-Winters method is a prognostic technique that can capture both tendance and seasonality in data, with the advantage of being able to adapt to no-seasonal series. Updates to the level, trend, and seasonality components are based on three smoothing parameters: α, β, and γ, where α (alpha) controls the smoothing of the level component, β (beta) controls the trend component, and γ (gamma) the seasonality component. As the series analysed on this work does not have a seasonal component, Holt-Winters model has been estimated in R specifying an inexistent gamma parameter. In the instances when α and β parameters are close to 1, we talk about a “smooth” forecast, while if they are close to 0, they reflect a “strong smoothing”. In the first case, recent past has a big weight on forecasting. In the second case, a higher importance is given to distant past. In this case, we could say near past has a bigger weight than remote past, because α is completely equal to 1 and β coefficient is relatively important.\nADAM-ETS: The ADAM-ETS method is an approach that combines exponential smoothing (ETS) approaches with state space models to model time series with error, trend, and seasonality components, also allowing the inclusion of other covariates. The smoothing coefficient alpha controls the relative importance of past observations in estimating the current level in the ETS model. In this case, the estimated value of alpha is 1.0, specifying that full weight is given to the most recent observation in the calculation of the current level. Beta captures the relevance of diƯerences between past observations in estimating the current trend in the ETS model, which has a value of 0.9999. This indicates that diƯerences between past observations have a very important weight in approximating the current trend. Phi represents the smoothing coefficient associated with the trend. A value equal to 1 suggests a complete weight to recent observations when estimating the trend, which means that the trend will adjust more quickly to recent changes in the data.\nSSARIMA: They are a prediction technique that combines the State Space with ARIMA methodology for the analysis and forecasting of temporal data, whose acronym meaning is: “State Space ARIMA”. In this way, these models can include ARIMA components to model the time structure of the series, as well as additional state space components to shape other unobservable factors that can influence the time series. Auto.sarima function in R preconised an ARIMA(0,0,3) model with a constant. We can see in Table 1 that the weight of each previous period MA decreases with the higher number of parameters. That is, the influence of the most distant periods is smaller compared to the closest ones. Indeed, coefficient of MA(1) is 0,5 while that of MA(3) equals 0,075.\nCES: Proposed by Svetunkov, Kourentzes and Ord in 2022, CES models refer to “Complex Exponential Smoothing” models. They are an extension of traditional exponential lysing methods that are based on the theory of complex variables and oƯer an innovative way to model and forecast time series. They can predict both stationary and non-stationary series, and can be adapted to seasonal data through their formulation in a state space form. Auto.ces function of R software estimated a CES(n) model, where n represents the non-seasonality term.\n\nAdditionally, AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and AICc (Corrected Information Criterion) have been included in order to compare models and be able to determine which one should be prioritized if we factor in this criterion. The AIC seeks to minimize the discrepancy between the model and the data, penalizing the complexity of the model. This means that a good model will be one that has a good fit but with a minimum number of parameters. The AICc is a correction to the AIC, especially useful when the sample size is small compared to the number of parameters.\nADAM-ETS offers the lowest AIC and AICc. This is the reason why this model is preferred to others if we consider this criterion. However, the differences of AIC and AICc between the different methods are small, meaning they have a similar quality in terms of their ability to fit the data and their complexity.\n\n\n2.2. Model’s predictions\nOnce the model’s parameters are defined, we can proceed to make predictions. For this, nine years of the original series had been kept with the aim to compare them with the forecast generated by the models. Graph 1 shows the forecast evolution of these nine years for each of the model along with actual data, going from 1839 to 1848. A naive prediction has also been included, which is a simple forecasting approach based on the assumption that the future value of a time series will be equal to the last observed value in the series. In other words, this method assumes there is no change in the time series and that the future value will be equal to the last observed one. Thus, this approach is useful as a reference to determine whether more complex models provide any significant prediction improvement.\n                                       Graph 1: Model’s predictions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe models that seem to better fit the real series are Holt-Winters, ARIMA and CES models, because they are the ones that have predicted a higher increase from 1838 to 1847. We observe the preference of ARIMA, which only contained MA components, compared to models with only an AR component. This suggests that the time series is more influenced by past errors than by past values. That is, the data may exhibit erratic or random behaviour, where future values depend primarily on past errors and not on a clear trend or pattern. Likewise, we can observe that Holt-Winters and CES methods have managed to fit the data relatively well. Indeed, they are designed to capture the trend and seasonality of the series (that in this case, there is no seasonality). The series grows rapidly over time, with a clear increasing trend, and these models, in particular Holt-Winters, are the ones, with ARIMA, that have the most predicted a pronounced increase with a higher growth rate. It appears that ADAM-ETS, on the contrary, even if it had the lowest AIC and AICc, presents higher error rates.\n\n\n\n3. Prediction evaluation\nTo evaluate the model’s performance, we are going to use four evaluation metrics:\n\nMean Squated Errors (MSE) : a statistical measure that provides a measure of how well the model achieves this goal. Indeed, this metric offers a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of a prediction model relative to the actual values. It is based on the difference between model predictions and true observations, squared to penalize larger errors, and then the average of these squared differences is calculated.\nDiebold-Mariano (DM) test: a statistical test used to compare the predictive accuracy of two time series models. This test was proposed by Francis X. Diebold and Robert S. Mariano in 1995, whose purpose is to determine whether there is a significant difference in the predictive performance between two models. The null hypothesis is that both models have the same predictive accuracy, while the alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the models offers a more accurate forecast. It will be used to compare each of the models with the naive forecast, which helps determine if the model in question is more interesting than making a simple prediction.\n𝑅 OOS: a measure of the predictive ability of a model when applied to new data that were not used to train the model. In essence, it measures how much variability in the dependent variable the model can explain in data not used in the fitting process. A higher out-of-sample R-squared value indicates a better predictive ability of the model on new data. It is also a valuable tool for comparing and evaluating the predictive performance of different models relative to a reference or benchmark model. If the value of this metric is greater than 0, it will be interpreted that the model in question has a superior predictive ability to the benchmark model. If it is less than zero, it will be the opposite, while if it is equal to 0, there will be no predictive difference. The naive forecast will be used as benchmark.\nCumulative Squared Prediction Error (CSPE): often used to evaluate the accuracy of predictions in time series models. It is calculated by adding the squared errors of the predictions over a given period. Squared errors are used to give more weight to large errors, reflecting the importance of avoiding large deviations in predictions.\nTable 2 summarizes the values of the three first mentioned metrics, while graph 2 shows the CSPE.\n\nTable 2: Model’s performance indicators\n\n\nModel\nMSE\nR OOS\nDM statistic\nDM p. value\n\n\n\n\nAR(1)\n0.1109\n0.2472\n0\n1\n\n\nARIMA\n0.0796\n0.4597\n0\n1\n\n\nHolt-Winters\n0.0918\n0.3769\n0\n1\n\n\nADAM-ETS\n0.1359\n0.0778\n0\n1\n\n\nCES\n0.0857\n0.4183\n0\n1\n\n\nSSARIMA\n0.1130\n0.2331\n0\n1\n\n\nNaive\n0.1474\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       Graph 2: Model’s CSPE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can judge that all the models seem to provide better prediction results compared to a simple naive forecast. Indeed, the 𝑅 𝑂𝑂𝑆 is always positive and even some models have relatively elevated values such as ARIMA or CES, between 0.4 and 0.5. Equally important, the Mean Squared Error of each model is lower than 0.147 , the MSE of the naive model. However, if we look at the DM test statistic and p. value, we can see that null hypothesis is accepted, meaning that there is no significant difference in the forecast accuracy between model i and the naive prediction. If we consider the CSPE, ARIMA seems to be the best model because the accumulated sum of errors is the smallest one, even if at the firsts stages, it starts with a higher prediction error than other methods such as SSARIMA, ADAM-ETS and AR1. On the contrary, these last models end up having much higher CSPE values. This observation can suggest that there exists a difference on the prediction ability between models in function of the forecast horizon. At the very short-term, ADAM-ETS, SSARIMA and AR(1) provide more reliable results, whereas from a horizon of about 7 or 8 periods, ARIMA, CES and Holt-Winters become more accurate. Finally, if we had to choose a better model on which we could comparatively rely, it would be ARIMA, because it presents the highest 𝑅 𝑂𝑂𝑆 value and the lowest MSE and CSPE.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this work analysed the trend of the historic evolution of the Spanish population. We have chosen and selected different prediction models to evaluate which one is more accuratelyadjusted to the structure of the series and which can be more reliable for use in a real-life situation. The result is that the ARIMA structure with three Moving Average processes has a minor prediction error. This model has predicted a tendency of increase for the near historical years, adjusting to the real life, with a satisfactory error term. Nevertheless, the analysis and exploration of other techniques might continue to get models with even lower prediction errors, and cross-validation with other independent data sources is recommended to confirm the robustness of the conclusions drawn from this constructed series."

    "title": "Essay: Technological change and employment",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nTechnology is rapidly growing and bringing innovations to society. While these advancements benefit us in many ways—such as through medical breakthroughs, task facilitation, faster communication, and improved transportation—they also raise concerns about the unemployment they might cause if human labor is replaced.\nThe book The Era of Digital Disruption by Javier Andrés and Rafael Doménech is one of many that explore how the digital revolution is transforming the economy and work. The authors analyze how technology has radically changed the way we consume, produce, behave, and how this transformation affects productivity and employment.\nI wrote a one-thousand-word essay in my second year of the Bachelor in Economcis explaining this phenomenon and showing the authors’ stance on the relationship between technology and employment.\n\n\nEssay\nCurrently, many jobs are threatened by a growing technological change in the form of machines and robots that can perform tasks more efficiently than humans and and at a lower price, and therefore, replace them. The unease about this phenomenon is not new. As Javier Andrés and Rafael Doménech point out, since the first Industrial Revolution, the introduction of mechanization led to a significant loss of labor in agriculture. However, this change was followed by a structural shift towards the secondary sector, resulting in the creation of new jobs and employment opportunities in the industry. Given the new context we face, where changes are happening at a dizzying pace, the current revolution differs from previous ones in a greater uncertainty and the possibility of observing greater technological unemployment. How significant is this possibility? Will it affect all types of work in the same way? Will the effect be the same in the short and long term?\nFirst, the authors point out an important difference between a time horizon of three or four decades, which is the subject of analysis in their work, and the very long term. In the latter case, it is more likely that technological change will lead to massive unemployment; however, the book presents various arguments to demonstrate that in the coming decades, the chances of this happening are much lower. On the one hand, it supports the predictive economic theory that technological innovations mean an increase in productivity that helps improve worker efficiency, which in turn increases wages, employment, and aggregate demand. Additionally, there is evidence from various countries where productivity has increased while unemployment has simultaneously decreased. For instance, between 1900 and 2018 in the United States, a country and period that has witnessed significant technological revolutions, GDP per capita multiplied by 8.8, while unemployment decreased by 0.2%. The authors argue that if unemployment has increased in a particular country, as in the case of Spain or Greece in recent decades, it is due to specific characteristics of their labor markets and not to technological change.\nOn the other hand, although it is inevitable that some jobs will be lost because they can be performed more economically and effectively by a robot or machine, new types of jobs are created simultaneously—a phenomenon that is well-advanced in the United States and China. To name a few examples, in the tourism sector, customers are increasingly less attended to in person, and many activities are conducted online, such as booking flight tickets or hotel reservations. While this may result in fewer staff at service counters, there is a growing demand for marketing workers who study customer preferences and create and digitally promote products and services. Entrepreneurs can also build businesses based on the ownership of robots, and the growing availability of databases requires more data scientists. Likewise, technology can be beneficial if the increase in capital efficiency leads to a similar increase in worker efficiency by facilitating their tasks. When these two factors are complementary, labor demand expands. According to the book, the effect generated by complementarity is greater than the substitutive effect, so the overall economy would benefit from technological innovations.\nHowever, the fact that the economy as a whole benefits does not mean that all individuals and economic sectors do. In fact, one of the main disadvantages is that this change is likely to be accompanied by an increase in inequality between social groups and a disparate evolution of labor demand depending on worker qualifications. Polarization is the main phenomenon. That is, machines and robots tend to replace medium-skilled jobs, those characterized by routine tasks, while concentrating employment at the two extremes of qualification: at one end are sectors requiring a high level of knowledge and skills, and at the other, those requiring more non-routine manual labor. This process is known as “routine-biased technical change,” which characterizes our era compared to the “skill-biased technical change” prevalent during the Industrial Revolution, whose implication was that low-skilled workers are threatened, while high-skilled workers benefit from increased demand for labor and higher wages.\nFurthermore, social concerns are growing regarding the quality of employment, which, although it has increased over an extended time horizon, has recently been declining. In particular, wages, working hours, social protection in markets, and job security have been negatively impacted in some productive sectors. Additionally, as a consequence of polarization, a considerable portion of routine workers will inevitably be shifted to non-routine manual tasks, where job quality and remuneration are generally lower.\nIn conclusion, the book argues that technological change will not cause massive unemployment in the coming decades. However, attention must be paid to certain sectors of society, as while some will benefit from reduced work effort and higher wages, others will face lower demand and lower wages, potentially increasing income inequality. To address these issues, it is important to adopt policies, strategies, and labor regulations that adjust and renew at the same pace as the changing needs of the population."

    "title": "Essay: The Spanish Uneven Industrialization and Regional Inequality",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn my second year of studying Economics, I wrote a short essay for the Economic History course on a topic that engaged me: how Spain industrialized unevenly in the nineteenth century and how this led to increased regional economic inequality. Industrialization was a significant process in history that brought about many important changes in societies, such as the introduction of machinery and advanced technologies, urbanization, capitalism and economic growth, and shifts in mentality and political ideas. However, inequalities became a major issue, as the gap between the rich and the poor widened. This could occur on an individual level due to disparities in income between owners and workers, but it could also be pronounced at a regional level, where industrialization affected some regions first while others remained stagnant. My essay focused on this latter case.\n\n\nEssay\nIndustrialization in Spain, whose origin dates to the first decades of the 19th century, represented a decisive point in the contemporary history of the country in terms of regional inequalities. Different studies have shown that the beginning of every modern economic growth spreads unevenly across space, affecting a few regions in a first instance and then increasing inequality (Williamson, 1965). Graph 1 shows this has been the Spanish case. Data provided by A.Carreras and X.Tafunell (2021) has been collected that analyse the trajectory of inequalities in terms of GDP per capita of the Spanish regions from the beginning of industrialization to its peak. For this, they have used the Gini index, an economic indicator that measures the level of inequality, ranging from zero (maximum uniformity) to one (maximum concentration). In it an ascending index is observed from the beginning of the 19th century until 1940.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalonia and in a lesser extent the Basque Country were the leading regions that led the beginning of industrialization, while most of the rest of Spain faced various obstacles that prevented a rapid resurgence of this sector. As we can see in graph 2, in which the three richest and most disadvantaged provinces have been selected in 1900 according to their nominal GDP per capita (NCDGP), Barcelona, Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya are the provinces found in the three first places. At the other extreme we find Cáceres, León and Lugo. With these figures, the differences between “rich” and “poor” are very appreciable.\n\n\n\n\n\n Catalonia is a region that rapidly became a powerful textile industry in the eighteenth century. On the contrary, in that same century, in the whole of Spain livestock and farming “represented around 70% of the total production” (Llombart, 2013) and it remained mainly agrarian until mid-twentieth century. Why was practically only this region able to catch-up with the main European industrial powers? Before such a revolution, it was a very agrarian society as the rest of Spain. However, along the eighteenth century it experienced social and economic changes, a phenomenon rigorously studied by P.Vilar in his work “La Catalogne dans l’Espagne moderne”, in which the foundations of the economic splendor experienced in the 19th century are set. On the one hand, the demographic increase is relevant. According to data provided by Jordi Nadal (1992), population went from being made up of 508,000 inhabitants in 1717 to 899,531 in 1787. From this, a growth rate of 77.07%1 is deducted. If we compare it with data on the growth of the whole Spain between these two dates, 7,500000 and 10,541.2000 respectively (Nadal, 1975), with a resulting growth rate of 38.79%, we can see that Catalan population has grown to a greater extent in relation to Spain, participating thus in the European demographic boom. This favorable boom for the Catalan economy was accompanied by an increase in agricultural productivity, especially in the vine sector, favored, among others, by the introduction of new irrigation techniques and the limitation of fallow land due to the use of natural fertilizers.\nNot only there was an intensive growth, also the cultivated areas increased. “With the exception, perhaps, of Cerdanya, there is no ‘country’ or region of the Principality of which some text from the 18th century does not indicate a more or less marked progress in the area under cultivation […] no region of some importance in the Catalan economic complex escaped this 18th century agricultural renovation” (Vilar,1962). With this information available and considering the Cobb-Douglas production function, it does not seem surprising that Catalonia participated in the process of modern economic growth. The rest of Spain, on the other hand, only managed to grow sparsely at an extensive level throughout 19th century, especially after Madoz disentailment- a liberal measure established in 1854 that disentailed land from communal properties- due to a land breaking process (Nadal, 1975).\nAccording to R. Garrabou and J.Sanz, cultivated area increased from 10.5 to 18.8 hectares between 1800 and 1888. Nevertheless, there was no improvement in productivity until the mid-20th century. This was, on one hand, because a large part of the territory was dedicated to the cultivation of cereals that, due to environmental and meteorological conditions, such as that in Spain it does not rain enough, meant an inefficient use of the soil. On the other hand, there were many small farmers who could not invest in technical-productive improvements due to their scarcity of economic resources, while large owners lacked incentives to do so because they acted as suppliers of land and job seekers for which they received large amounts of income in exchange for small costs (wages were low), from which sufficient profits are deducted and they are not interested in maximizing production by increasing productivity.\nAs far as agriculture is concerned, having understood that Catalonia experienced a strong expansion while most of the Spanish provinces remained stagnant, it is convenient to analyse the effects these differences had on the industry development. A fundamental element that is present in every industrialization process is structural change, understood as a transfer of economic activity from the primary to the secondary sector, resulting from an increase in agricultural productivity that allows a massive movement from the countryside to the city. If Spain did not experience structural change until the middle of the 20th century, Catalonia did so at the beginning of the previous century. Furthermore, agricultural progress translates into the creation of a manufacturing market. One of the main problems faced by the industry in Spain was the lack of a market for industrial goods because there was not enough demand, an argument developed and defended by different authors, among which Jordi Nadal (1975) stands out. Agriculture is a provider of food, a basic need for the survival of humans, therefore it is understood that the first thing that a society is going to demand is this. If agriculture remains stagnant, food supply fails to meet all demand, which is responsible for a rise in prices that prevents people from demanding, for example, industrial goods. If to this fact we add the paltry wages of small farmers and day laborers, who were most of the population, there is more evidence to reinforce the population’s lack of purchasing power. In Catalonia the opposite happened. Maluquer (1987) has shown how this region benefited from an agricultural expansion accompanied by an increase in income whose distribution was sufficiently egalitarian and wide to supply the entire population.\nWhat has been explained so far concerns the role played by agriculture. However, we may also consider the relationship between relative prices of production factors . We have descriptive evidence from recent studies (Martínez-Galarraga, Prat, 2016) that affirm that in the cotton sector of the Catalan textile industry relative price of labor and capital factors prompted the mechanization of cotton spinning tasks by adopting the Spinning Jenny, imitating the British model. This happened when most of Spain was still agrarian, in addition to the already mentioned reasons, because the existing relationship between factor prices along with their availability encouraged continued growth based on intensive use of the labor factor. As reported by A. Carreras and X. Tafunell (2021), labor and land were abundant at an affordable price, while capital was scarce and expensive.\nOnce the foundations of the textile industry in Catalonia were established, it grew even more from the second half of the 19th century, a period in which national and international market began to integrate. This process had special repercussions on Catalonia industry. Many studies, analysing the case from the new economic geography models, have shown its first industrialization steps were reinforced by market integration that concentrated and agglomerated the industry in the region. From there arose economies of agglomeration in the productive processes that attracted firms and workers. According to the indications of Jordi Nadal (1975), in 1850 the Catalan spindles represented 6.01 percent of the Spanish set, becoming 18.52 percent in 1861. On the other hand, market integration promoted regional specialization and the interior of Spain specialized in agriculture since that represented their comparative advantage, so this was a disadvantage for the industry. “Summarizing, this period was characterized by a growth in the distance between industrial and agrarian Spain. Castile became an industrial desert. In contrast, Catalonia was Spain’s factory.” (Paluzie, Pons, Tirado, 2002).\nIn this same period another steel industry gained strength in the Basque Country, becoming the most powerful one in southern Europe. This region was privileged by the existence of a quite useful material -non phosphorous iron ore- that favored by a “double freight” system in which the mineral was exported to Great Britain in exchange for the import of Welsh coal, made possible 6 the emergence of an steel industry. In 1902, the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya company was created, “the largest company in Spain in the 20th century”. The Basque Country stands out by the coal’s possession at a cheap price, an energy source that signified a weakness for the Spanish industrialization due to its scarcity and hence expensive adoption.\nIt is worth mentioning the textile and metallurgic industries benefited from the protection of the sector through the establishment of tariff measures. For instance, the 1802 law had a relevant weight in the initial development of Catalonia industry since, by preventing the importation of foreign yarns, it promoted the adoption of more modern machines -from the “bergadana” to the “mule” (Nadal,1975). Regarding the Basque Country, tariff measures also played a fundamental role in protecting industry from mainly two countries: the United Kingdom and Germany, which had a considerable steel production. Unfortunately, protectionism had adverse effects on Spanish agriculture since, among others, it maintained food prices high, eliminating incentives to improve and modernize it.\nOnce we have understood that Catalonia and the Basque Country were the succeeding places to industrialize in the nineteenth century, we must ask ourselves why this made them to achieve greater levels of GDP per capita than the regions that remained agrarian. To this aim, let consider, as economic theory predicts, that the main determinant of GDP per capita growth is labor productivity growth and that this latter depends on efficiency levels and capital deepening. As we know that industrialization is based on an intensive use of capital whereas agrarian societies are labor intensive sectors, and that the use of capital is generally associated with higher efficiency since more output is obtained with lower amounts of inputs, we can deduct that every industrialized region will account with more labor productivity and therefore with a higher GDP per capita. Finally, inequalities among regions were reduced from 1960s following the Williamson´s U-inverted theory. The migratory flow from the most backward to the most prosperous regions that acted as regulator of per capita income and the implementation of public policies made it possible to happen."

    "text": "This a project we made on the PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) technique, a method used to classify data into groups. This approach is particularly helpful when dealing with datasets that have many variables, especially when it is necessary to separate the data into different categories. The technique works by creating latent variables, which are new variables that summarize the most relevant information from the original data. We applied this method in the context of verifying salmon authenticity, as demonstrated below.\n\nIntroduction\nThe objective of our study is to find a predictive model of salmon authenticity on the dataset from the publication “Data fusion and multivariate analysis for food authenticity analysis.” written by Hong, Y., Birse, N., Quinn, B., Li, Y., Jia, W., McCarron, P., … & Elliott, C. T. in 2023. The initial dataset contains information on the 38-element chemical composition of 521 salmon from four different countries. However, elements present in extremely high quantities or too low to be measured accurately were removed from the dataset before further analysis, leaving only 20 chemical elements. Similarly, the values of these elements were normalized on a scale of 0 to 1.\nWe decided to apply the PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares regression Discriminant Analysis) approach. This method consists in classifying individuals according to the categories of the qualitative variable Y (the origin of the salmon in our study), in a discriminating manner by finding the best possible latent variables, these being combinations of the predictors and the qualitative variable. Moreover, this approach seems particularly interesting in this analysis given that some of the chemical elements (explanatory variables) show strong multicollinearity between them, making multinomial regression inviable. To start our study, we perform a preliminary descriptive analysis to better understand the relationships between the variables and the structure of our dataset. Next, the PLS-DA model will be explored by looking for latent components or variables, with cross-validation to assess the performance of the PLS-DA model. To do this, we first set up a training sample, made up of 80% of our population, and a test sample with the remaining 20% to analyze the quality of the prediction. The model will be considered of good quality if it has a low error rate, i.e. when the majority of salmon rankings are validated.\n\n\n1. Descriptive analysis\nAs introduced, descriptive analysis is an essential step prior to any type of work on a database. We begin by projecting a histogram of the dependent qualitative variable “Class”, which indicates the country of origin of each salmon, available in Figure 1. In addition, the origin of these fish is distributed according to the two different production methods.\n             Figure 1: Salmon by country and production method\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the distribution of this variable, we can see that farmed salmon are the most represented, with the Scottish and Norwegian countries alone recording almost 300 salmon, accompanied by 90 Irish salmon. Wild-caught salmon, represented by Alaska and Ireland, are in the minority, with overall numbers hovering around 150 salmon, or half the number of the other production method.\nNext, we find it interesting to understand this distribution through the analysis of chemical elements, which will enable us to highlight the particularities of each country. To do this, we decided to represent the distribution of each chemical element with boxplots in Figure 2.\n             Figure 2: Statistical distribution of chemical elements\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that a group of variables made up of “Al”, “Cr”, “Cu”, “Fe”, “Co”, “Mn”, “Mo”, “Ni”, “Sr” and “V” show very distant points. After analysis, the salmon from the fishery meet these characteristics. Alaskan salmon, for example, are very rich in copper, molybdenum and nickel. Icelandic salmon are also highly concentrated in iron, strontium and vanadium.\nFinally, analysis of the relationships between predictors using correlation calculations informs us that a number of variables are strongly positively correlated with each other, such as “Zn” and “Se”, “Se” and “Rb” or “Rb” and “Cs”. This strong collinearity reinforces the use of PLS-DA regression in this study.\n\n\n2. PLS-DA Model\nBefore performing the classification, we split the database into a training set, with 80% of all observations, and a test set, with the remaining 20% of observations. First, the PLS-DA model was run on the training set using the MixOmics library. For dimension reduction, we selected the 20 initial components, corresponding to the 20 predictors, which helped us to visualize and identify the most appropriate number of components to minimize the classification error rate while resulting in a parsimonious model. Parsimony suggests that, among models that are equally effective at explaining or predicting data, the one that is simplest or uses the fewest variables is preferred. This translates into the search for models that perform well, but are no more complex than necessary. Model simplicity can help avoid over-fitting, when a model over-fits training data and has difficulty generalizing to new data. Figure 3 shows the classification error rate as a function of the number of components or dimensions. The error rate decreases significantly up to dimension 5, with a value equal to 0.06, then increases slightly and decreases again insignificantly. We would have to enlarge up to component 18 to find an error value smaller than that provided by dimension 5, however, this does not seem appropriate given the relevance of the parsimony criterion.\n          Figure 3: Classification error rate as a function of the number of components\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Figure 4 shows the salmon rankings performed on five dimensions. We can see that only individuals 98 and 25, belonging to Alaskan, failed to group correctly. We can also see that the Norway, Scotland and Iceland-F groups do not have a clear separation, which could mislead the prediction.\n            Figure 4: PLS-DA on five dimensions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Performance evaluation\nThe test sample was then used to check the model’s performance. The “overall”, “max.dist”, “centroids.dist” and “mahalanobis.dist” metrics are commonly used, with distinct performance measurement methods, to assess the quality of the PLS-DA model in terms of its ability to distinguish different groups. We select the “max.dist” metric as it stands out from the other metrics for its objective of maximizing the separation between classes, which is a key criterion in our study for achieving a clear distinction between them. In addition, in Figure 5 it provides the ideal number of components described above. This distance metric reveals an accuracy rate of 0.95 and an error rate of 0.049.\nSimilarly, a confusion matrix was run on Table 1 to visualize the distribution of salmon between their initial classes and those predicted by the model. Only one salmon was predicted for Norway and one for Scotland while belonging to the Iceland-F class, and three salmon for Scotland while belonging to Norway. These results confirm the model’s ability to distinguish between classes and its accuracy. This is confirmed by Figure 5, which shows the ROC (Recieving Operating Characteristic) curve. Indeed, all the lines corresponding to the different classes provide information on the quality of the specificity and sensitivity indices, which are very good in view of the very high curves, also indicating AUC values close to 1.\n\nTabe 1: Confusion matrix PLS-DA\n\n\n\nAlaskan\nIceland-F\nIceland-W\nNorway\nScotland\n\n\n\n\nAlaskan\n19\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nIceland-F\n0\n9\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nIceland-W\n0\n0\n18\n0\n0\n\n\nNorway\n0\n0\n0\n18\n3\n\n\nScotland\n0\n0\n0\n0\n35\n\n\n\n             Figure 5: ROC Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The most discriminating and interesting chemical elements to keep \nFinally, we identify the important variables for class prediction by studying their weights on all five components.\nIn Figure 6, we can see that the most discriminating chemical elements, with an error rate of 6%, are, in order of importance, boron, lithium, cadium, carbon monoxide, selenium, iron and caesium. \n             Figure 6: Variables contribution to components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the study consisted in predicting the geographical origin of the salmon in the database using PLS-DA regression. Before applying the prediction model, we carried out a univariate descriptive analysis of our qualitative variable “Class”, which enabled us to observe the distribution of the four countries to be discriminated and to discover which production mode was most represented. We then proceeded with the five-component PLS-DA analysis, built on the training set with the “max.dist” metric. We obtained a high-performance model with good predictive quality, presenting an AUC close to 1 for each group to be discriminated, accompanied by a very low error rate of 4%. The chemical elements that emerged as the most discriminating were lithium, boron, iron, carbon monoxide, selenium, cadmium and cesium. However, class separation was not very clear-cut. Similarly, it would have been interesting to perform a discriminant factor analysis (DFA) to compare and complete our interpretation of the discriminating power of the predictors."
